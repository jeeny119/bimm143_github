Today we will take a wee step back to some data we can taste and explore the correlation structure and principal components of some Halloween candy. 

## Data Import

```{r}
candy_file <- "candy-data.csv"

candy = read.csv(candy_file, row.names=1)
head(candy)
```

> Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

```{r}
nrow(candy)
```

> Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

```{r}
sum(candy$fruity)
```


## What is your favorite candy? 

> Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?

```{r}
candy ["Twix",]$winpercent
```

```{r}
candy["Almond Joy",]$winpercent
```

```{r}
candy["M&M's",]$winpercent
```

> Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat",]$winpercent
```

> Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars",]$winpercent
```


## Exploratory Analysis 

We can use the **skimr** package to get a quick overview of a given dataset. This can be useful for the first time you encounter a new dataset. 

```{r}
skimr::skim(candy)
```

> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset? 

It looks like the last column `candy$winpercent` is on a different scale to all others. 

> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

Based on the table above in `candy` dataset, I believe that a chocolate column includes several zero and one. As the information on chocolate column is encoded as integer, it is likely for a zero to represent FALSE and a one to represent TRUE. Therefore, a one likely represents that the candy contains chocolate, and a zero refers that it does not contain chocolate in the candy$chocolate column. 

> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
hist(candy$winpercent, breaks=30)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent) + 
  geom_histogram(bins=10, fill="lightblue")
```

> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

Based on the observation of results above, the distribution of winpercent values is not symmetrical. 

> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

Determining the center of the distribution depends on which parameters we choose, such as median or mean. However, as I chose the median as a parameter, the center of distribution is below 50% since the median is below 50% (47.83%). 

```{r}
summary(candy$winpercent)
```

> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

```{r}
choc.inds <- candy$chocolate==1
choc.candy <- candy[choc.inds,]
choc.win <- choc.candy$winpercent
mean(choc.win)
```

On average, the chocolate candy is higher ranked than fruity candy since the mean for winpercent of chocolate candy is over 50%. The below result is the ranking of fruity candy by measuring the mean for winpercent of fruity candy: 44.11974%. 

```{r}
fruit.win1 <- candy[as.logical(candy$fruity), ]$winpercent
mean(fruit.win1)
```

```{r}
fruit.inds <- candy$fruity==1
fruit.candy <- candy[fruit.inds,]
fruit.win <- fruit.candy$winpercent
mean(fruit.win)
```

> Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
ans <- t.test(choc.win, fruit.win)
ans
```

Yes, with a P-value of `r ans$p.value`. 

```{r}
ans$p.value
```

Notes: Based on the result above, I believe that this difference is statistically significant between these two candies (chocolate candy and fruity candy) because the p-value is significantly low as 2.871378e-08. 


## 3. Overall Candy Rankings 

> Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

There are two related functions that can help here, one is the classic `sort()` and `order()`. 

```{r}
x <- c(5,10,1,4)
sort(x, decreasing=T)
```

```{r}
order(x)
```

```{r}
inds <- order(candy$winpercent)
head (candy[inds,], 5)
```

Nik L Nip, Boston Baked Beans, Chiclets, Super Bubble, and Jawbusters are the five least liked candy types in this set. 

> Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

```{r}
inds <- order(candy$winpercent, decreasing =T)
head(candy[inds,], 5)
```

Based on the result above, the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set are Reese's Peanut Butter cup, Reese's Miniatures, Twix, Kit Kat, and Snickers. 

> Q15. Make a bar plot and order it by winpercent values.  

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) + 
  geom_col()
```

> Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent? 

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent,reorder(rownames(candy), winpercent)) + 
  geom_col()
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent,reorder(rownames(candy), winpercent)) + 
  geom_col(fill="red")
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(x= winpercent,
      y= reorder(rownames(candy), winpercent), 
      fill=chocolate)+ 
  geom_col()
```

Here we want a custom color vector to color each bar the way we want - with `chocolate` and `fruity` candy together with whether it is a `bar` or not.

```{r}
mycols <- rep ("gray", nrow(candy))
mycols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] <- "chocolate"
mycols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] <- "pink"
mycols[as.logical(candy$bar)] <- "brown"

#mycols 

ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent,reorder(rownames(candy), winpercent)) + 
  geom_col(fill=mycols)

ggsave("mybarplot.png", width=3, height=6)
```

Now, for the first time, using this plot we can answer questions like:

> Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?
 
The worst ranked chocolate candy is Sixlets. 
 
> Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

The best ranked fruity candy is Starburst.

## Winpercent vs. Pricepercent 

```{r}
#Pink and grey is too light, let's change to red and black 

mycols <- rep ("black", nrow(candy))
mycols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] <- "chocolate"
mycols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] <- "red"
mycols[as.logical(candy$bar)] <- "brown"


library(ggrepel)

# How about a plot of price vs win
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=mycols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=mycols, size=2, max.overlaps = 8)
```


## 5. Correlation Structure 

```{r}
cij <- cor(candy)
cij
```

```{r}
library (corrplot)

corrplot(cij)
```


> Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?
 
Based on the plot above, I believe that chocolate and fruity candy are negatively correlated because their correlation value are the most negative: -0.74. It is also shown in the plot as biggest size of red circle representing as negative.  

```{r}
round(cij["chocolate", "fruity"], 2)
```

> Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

I believe that bar candy and chocolate candy are the most positively correlated. 


## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

We need to be sure to scale our input `candy` data before PCA as we have the `winpercent` column on a different scale to all others in the dataset. 

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale=T)
summary (pca) 
```

First main result figure is my "PCA plot" 

```{r}
#pca$x
ggplot(pca$x) + 
  aes (PC1, PC2, label=rownames(pca$x)) + 
  geom_point(col=mycols) + 
  geom_text_repel(max.overlaps=6, col=mycols) + 
  theme_bw() 
```


The second main PCA result is in the `pca$rotation` we can plot this to generate a so-called "loagings plot". 

```{r}
#pca$rotation 
ggplot(pca$rotation) + 
  aes(PC1, rownames(pca$rotation)) + 
  geom_col()
```

```{r}
ggplot(pca$rotation) + 
  aes(PC1, reorder(rownames(pca$rotation), PC1), fill=PC1) + 
  geom_col()
```

> Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

Based on the plots above, I believe that the fruity, pluribus meaning the candy coming in a bag or box of multiple candies, and hard candies are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction. This result makes sense pretty well because fruity and chocolate are negatively correlated. The fruity candies are not likely to contain the chocolate, and similarly, the chocolate candies are not likely to include any fruity taste. Things related to chocolate is shown in the opposite direction of fruity/pluribus/hard candies' direction.
